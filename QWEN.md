## INHERITED FROM constitution/QWEN.md

All rules in `constitution/QWEN.md` (and the `constitution/Constitution.md`
it references) apply unconditionally. This module's rules below extend them —
they do NOT weaken any universal clause. When this file disagrees with the
constitution submodule, the constitution wins. Locate the constitution
submodule from any arbitrary nested depth using its `find_constitution.sh`
helper.

The universal anti-bluff covenant (§11.4), no-guessing mandate (§11.4.6),
credentials-handling mandate (§11.4.10), host-session safety (§12 + §12.6 +
§12.10), and data safety (§9) all live in `constitution/Constitution.md`.
Read it before working on any non-trivial change.

## How this file relates to CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md

Per §11.4.35 canonical-root inheritance clarity:

- `constitution/QWEN.md` is the universal canonical root for the Qwen Code CLI.
- This file is the consumer-side extension for this submodule, carrying only
  the inheritance pointer + the §11.4 covenant anchors + a brief module summary.
- The full module ruleset lives in this submodule's sibling `CLAUDE.md`.
  Qwen Code agents MUST read CLAUDE.md before performing any work; this
  QWEN.md is the Qwen-specific entry point that ensures Qwen reads the
  inheritance pointer + anti-bluff covenant on every session.

## Module summary

Orchestration layer for HelixQA's multi-LLM workflows. Coordinates LLMProvider instances, executes Challenge dispatch, and produces structured QA verdicts.

For full module context (build steps, integration points, host-session safety,
submodule-specific commit/push discipline) read this directory's `CLAUDE.md`
and `AGENTS.md`.

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF COVENANT — END-USER QUALITY GUARANTEE (User mandate, 2026-04-28)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all
> Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work
> and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and
> Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability
> by end users of the product!"

This is the historical origin of the project's anti-bluff covenant. Every
test, every Challenge, every gate, every mutation pair exists to make the
failure mode (PASS on broken-for-end-user feature) mechanically impossible.

**Operative rule:** the bar for shipping is **not** "tests pass" but
**"users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry
positive evidence captured during execution that the feature works for the
end user. Metadata-only PASS, configuration-only PASS, "absence-of-error"
PASS, and grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are all critical defects
regardless of how green the summary line looks.

**Tests AND Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — a Challenge that
scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of defect as a
unit test that does. Both must produce positive end-user evidence; both
are subject to the §8.1 five-constraint rule and §11 captured-evidence
requirement.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule
[`Constitution.md`](../../../../constitution/Constitution.md) §11.4 (this
end-user-quality-guarantee forensic anchor — propagation requirement
enforced by pre-build gate `CM-COVENANT-114-QWEN-PROPAGATION`).

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

## §11.4 extension anchors carried by this file

The following extension anchors apply unconditionally to every change
landed in this submodule. Their full text lives in the sibling CLAUDE.md
and in the canonical `constitution/Constitution.md`. Listed here so Qwen
Code agents can locate them by literal string match:

- **§11.4.1 extension (Phase 33, 2026-05-05)** — FAIL-bluffs equally
  forbidden. A test that crashes for a script-internal reason and produces
  a FAIL exit code is just as misleading as a PASS-bluff. Fix at source
  layer, never at call sites.
- **§11.4.2 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06)** — Recorded-evidence
  requirement. Every PASS for a user-visible feature MUST be cross-checked
  by the analyzer against the dual-display recording + action timeline.
- **§11.4.3 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06)** — Per-device-topology test
  dispatch. Topology-touching tests MUST detect topology at entry and
  dispatch the topology-appropriate variant.
- **§11.4.4 extension (User mandate, 2026-05-06)** —
  Test-interrupt-on-discovery + retest-from-clean-baseline. The moment any
  defect is re-discovered or newly identified mid-cycle, STOP and fix at
  root cause + four-layer coverage + full rebuild + reflash + retest.
- **§11.4.4 expansion (User mandate, 2026-05-06)** — Systematic debugging
  via superpowers skills + four-layer test coverage per fix (pre-build
  gate + post-build gate + post-flash on-device test + HelixQA Challenge +
  paired mutation) + documentation update + no-bluff certification per
  cycle.
- **§11.4.5 — Audio + video quality analysis comprehensiveness (User mandate, 2026-05-07)** —
  Audio: presence + channel count + sample rate + glitch census +
  coexistence-artifact census. Video: presence + routing target + frame
  health + obstruction census + resolution + codec. Challenges bound equally.
- **§11.4.6 — No-guessing mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-08)** —
  Forbidden vocabulary: `likely`, `probably`, `maybe`, `might`,
  `possibly`, `presumably`, `seems`, `appears to`. Prove with
  captured evidence OR mark `UNCONFIRMED:` / `UNKNOWN:` /
  `PENDING_FORENSICS:`.
- **§11.4.7 — Demotion-evidence rule (Phase 38.X+2 amendment, 2026-05-11)** —
  Demotion from FAIL to lower-severity requires positive evidence captured
  under the same conditions that originally exposed the defect.
- **§11.4.8 — Deep-web-research-before-implementation mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)** —
  Cite external source URL OR literal "NO external solution found — original
  work" in every non-trivial fix.
- **§11.4.9 — Batch-source-fixes-before-rebuild mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)** —
  All source-side fixes that DO NOT require runtime on-device validation
  MUST be landed BEFORE the next firmware rebuild.
- **§11.4.10 — Credentials-handling mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)** —
  Credentials NEVER live in tracked files. `.env` git-ignored project-wide.
  Tests load from `scripts/testing/secrets/` (chmod 600).
- **§11.4.13 — Out-of-band sink-side captured-evidence mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-13)** —
  When an HDMI sink with network-accessible introspection API is present,
  every audio test MUST consume the sink's report as captured-evidence.
- **§11.4.14 — Test playback cleanup mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-13)** —
  Every test that issues `am start` / `cmd media_session play` MUST
  issue matching `am force-stop` / `KEYCODE_MEDIA_STOP` + EXIT trap.
- **§11.4.15 — Item-status tracking mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-13)** —
  Every active item in `Issues.md` carries a `**Status:**` line.
- **§11.4.16 — Item-type tracking mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-14)** —
  Every active item in `Issues.md` carries a `**Type:**` line with one
  of `{Bug | Feature | Task}`.
- **§11.4.40 — Full-suite retest before release tag mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-17)** —
  Release tag MUST NOT be created until a complete retest with ALL existing
  tests has been executed on a clean baseline.
- **§11.4.41 — Pre-Force-Push Merge-First Mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-17)** —
  Every force-push MUST be preceded by a mechanical 4-step merge-first
  pipeline (fetch + integrate + audit + push with `--force-with-lease`).

## MANDATORY §12.6 MEMORY-BUDGET CEILING — 60% MAXIMUM (User mandate, 2026-04-30)

Project procedures MUST NOT use more than **60% of total system RAM**
(`HOST_SAFETY_MAX_MEM_PCT`). The remaining 40% is reserved for the
operator's other workloads. There is NO operator-facing override flag.

`scripts/build.sh` wraps `m -j` in `bounded_run` so only the
bounded scope is OOM-killed if the build's collective RSS exceeds the
budget — `user@<uid>.service` stays alive.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule
[`Constitution.md`](../../../../constitution/Constitution.md) §12.6.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

## §11.4.69 — Universal Sink-Side Positive-Evidence Taxonomy + Mechanical Enforcement (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.69)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"THIS MUST HAPPEN NEVER AGAIN!!! We MUST HAVE this all working! Not just for audio but for every single piece of the System!!! Proper full automation when executed with success MUST MEAN that manual testing will be as much positive at least regarding the success results! ... Solution MUST BE universal, generic that solves working flows for all System components and for all future and all existing projects! ... Everything we do MUST BE validated and verified with rock-solid proofs and anti-bluff policy enforcement and fulfillment!"*

Universal generalisation of §11.4.68 (audio-specific) across every user-visible feature class. Every user-visible feature MUST map to one entry in the closed-set §11.4.69 sink-side evidence taxonomy (`audio_output`, `audio_input`, `video_display`, `network_throughput`, `network_connectivity`, `bluetooth_a2dp`, `bluetooth_pair`, `touch_input`, `sensor`, `gpu_render`, `storage_read`, `storage_write`, `mediacodec_decode`, `mediacodec_encode`, `miracast`, `cast`, `boot_service`, `package_install`, `permission_grant`, `wifi_link`, `wifi_throughput`, `ethernet_link`, `display_topology`, `drm_playback`, `subtitle_render` — open to additions, never contraction). Every PASS for a feature in the taxonomy MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact path matching the required evidence shape. New helper contracts (additive during grace, mandatory after 2026-06-19): `ab_pass_with_evidence <description> <evidence_path>` (verifies path exists + non-empty), `ab_skip_with_reason <description> <closed-set-reason>` (reasons: `geo_restricted`, `operator_attended`, `hardware_not_present`, `topology_unsupported`, `network_unreachable_external`, `feature_disabled_by_config`; forbids `network_unreachable_external` for any taxonomy feature with a sink-side probe); bare `ab_pass` deprecated (WARN pre-grace, FAIL post-grace). Three pre-build gates + paired §1.1 mutations: `CM-SINK-EVIDENCE-PER-FEATURE`, `CM-NO-FAIL-OPEN-SKIP`, `CM-AB-PASS-WITH-EVIDENCE-EVERYWHERE`. No escape hatch — no `--skip-evidence`, `--config-only-pass`, `--allow-fail-open-skip`, `--legacy-ab-pass-permitted` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.69` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-69-PROPAGATION` enforces the anchor literal across the consumer fleet; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the sink-side-evidence layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.69 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.75 — Mechanical Enforcement Without Exception (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.75)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Why do these violations still happen!? This is a serious problem! We cannot rely on stability nor consistency if we cannot respect our Constitution, mandatory rules and constraints! Is there a way to make this always respected, followed and applied without exception fully and unconditionally!? WE MUST HAVE THIS WORKING FLAWLESSLY!!! Do investigate the root causes of such problems! Once all problems are identified WE MUST apply proper mechanisms for this not to happen NEVER EVER AGAIN!"*

The §11.4 covenant historically relied on agent + operator vigilance; three 2026-05-19→20 forensic incidents proved that late-binding enforcement fires hours-to-days after the violator commit reaches every remote. §11.4.75 closes the gap with FIVE independent mechanical enforcement layers — bypassing any single layer does not bypass the discipline: (1) local `pre-commit` git hook (refuses staged `.md` lacking sibling `.html`+`.pdf`); (2) `commit_all.sh` integration (`_constitution_sibling_check` + auto-`sync_all_markdown_exports.sh` self-repair); (3) local `pre-push` git hook (re-runs siblings + propagation-gate subset); (4) `post-commit` auto-repair hook (auto-generates orphan-`.md` siblings, idempotent + recursion-guarded); (5) local-only final-gate ritual (remote CI DISABLED per User mandate — operator runs `pre_build_verification.sh` + meta-test before every tag per §11.4.40). Helper contracts: `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`, `scripts/git_hooks/{pre-commit,pre-push,post-commit,commit-msg}`, `_constitution_sibling_check`. The `commit-msg` hook enforces a `Bypass-rationale: <reason>` footer when `--no-verify` is detected; `docs/audit/bypass_events.md` accumulates the audit trail. Five gates with paired §1.1 mutations: `CM-COVENANT-114-75-PROPAGATION`, `CM-GIT-HOOKS-INSTALL-SCRIPT`, `CM-GIT-HOOKS-SOURCE-DIR`, `CM-COMMIT-ALL-SIBLING-CHECK`, `CM-CI-WORKFLOW-PRESENT`. No escape hatch — no `--skip-hooks`, `--bypass-enforcement`, `--allow-orphan-md`, `--ci-not-applicable`, `--mechanical-enforcement-not-needed` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.75` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-75-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the enforcement layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.75 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.76 — Containers-Submodule Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.76)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"For any work or requirements of running services or codebase inside the Containers (Docker / Podman / Qemy / Emulators, and so on) we MUST USE / INCORPORATE the Containers Submodule properly: https://github.com/vasic-digital/containers (git@github.com:vasic-digital/containers.git). Containers Submodule contains all means for us to Containerize our code and services! If any feature or Containing System is missing or not supported we MUST EXTEND IT properly like we do all of our projects! No bluff work is allowed of any kind!"*

For ANY containerized workload (Docker / Podman / Qemu / Kubernetes / container-backed emulators), every consuming project MUST: (1) install `vasic-digital/containers` (`digital.vasic.containers`) as a Git submodule; (2) consume via `replace` directive during development + pinned commit SHAs in production; (3) boot infra on-demand via `pkg/boot` + `pkg/compose` + `pkg/health` so operators are never required to start `podman machine` / `docker compose up` manually — the boot is part of the test entry point (the on-demand-infra invariant); (4) extend the Submodule (PR upstream) for missing runtimes / lifecycle primitives — never reimplement in-project (per §11.4.74); (5) anti-bluff: integration tests claiming to exercise containerized components MUST actually boot them via the Submodule — short-circuit fakes that bypass boot are a §11.4 violation. Tracker rows touching containerization MUST record `Catalogue-Check: extend vasic-digital/containers@<sha>` (or `reuse`). Planned gate `CM-CONTAINERS-USED` scans container-touching PRs for `digital.vasic.containers/...` imports; paired mutation strips the import + asserts FAIL.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.76` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-76-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.76 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.77 — Regeneration-Mechanism-Required Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.77)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"We must be sure that after excluding anything from Git versioning we still have the mechanism which will out of the box obtain or re-generate missing content!"*

Every `.gitignore` entry excluding (a) >~100 MiB OR (b) any artefact essential to building / running / testing the project MUST carry a documented + automated mechanism to either re-obtain (download from authoritative source: vendor tarball, SDK installer, npm/pip/cargo/go-mod/container registry, dedicated git submodule, S3/GCS) OR re-generate (run from tracked source via build pipeline, code-gen, asset render, captured-evidence replay, container build). Required artefacts per qualifying entry: (1) `.gitignore-meta/<entry-slug>.yaml` declaring pattern + mechanism-type + script-path + expected-disk-usage + vendor-url-or-source + integrity hash + requires-network + requires-credentials; (2) a non-interactive entry in `scripts/setup.sh` post-clone bootstrap; (3) a pre-build gate verifying regenerated content present OR a recent `.gitignore-meta/.regenerated/<slug>.ok` stamp; (4) README + `docs/guides/*.md` describing the mechanism + manual fallback + time/disk budget + §11.4.10 credentials. Bare `.gitignore` additions without the mechanism are a §11.4 PASS-bluff variant — codebase appears complete but a fresh clone cannot build/run. No escape hatch — no `--skip-regen-mechanism`, `--gitignore-is-enough`, `--operator-already-has-content` flag. Planned gate `CM-GITIGNORE-REGEN-MECHANISM` + paired §1.1 mutation (strip a required YAML key → gate FAILs).

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.77` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-77-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the repository-hygiene layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.77 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.78 — CodeGraph Code-Intelligence Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.78)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Make codegraph MANDATORY CHOICE for this purpose for all of our project ... All project which do not have configured and installed codegraph yet MUST DO IT and MUST USE IT!"*

Every consuming project worked on by AI coding agents MUST install, initialize, and use **CodeGraph** (`https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph`, npm `@colbymchenry/codegraph`) — a local SQLite semantic code-knowledge-graph exposed to agents over MCP (100% local, no cloud). (1) Install globally via npm with a user-writable npm prefix (no `sudo`). (2) `codegraph init` + `codegraph index`: `.codegraph/config.json` is tracked, `.codegraph/codegraph.db` is gitignored with `codegraph index` as its §11.4.77 regeneration mechanism; the `config.json` `exclude` list MUST exclude every credential/secret path per §11.4.10. (3) Wire `codegraph serve --mcp` into every CLI agent (Claude Code `.mcp.json`, OpenCode `opencode.json`, Qwen Code `.qwen/settings.json`, Crush `.crush.json`, host-local otherwise) referencing the bare `codegraph` command on `PATH` (no hardcoded host path). (4) Cover the integration with an anti-bluff suite whose per-agent end-to-end layer uses an unforgeable challenge (a fact obtainable only by calling a CodeGraph MCP tool, e.g. index node count via `codegraph_status`); a genuinely un-drivable agent is a documented SKIP per §11.4.3, never a faked PASS. (5) Document in `docs/CODEGRAPH.md`, kept in sync per §11.4.12 / §11.4.65. CodeGraph is consumed as the published npm package (§11.4.74) — not a git submodule, adds no Git remote. Planned gate `CM-CODEGRAPH-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutation (strip a secret-exclusion → gate FAILs).

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.78` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-78-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.78 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.79 — Own-Org Submodules MUST Be Included in the CodeGraph Index (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.79)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"All Submodules we use in the project and that are part of organizations to which we have the full access via GitHub, GitLab and other CLIs MUST BE included into the codegraph database and initialized / scanned / synced!"*

Refines §11.4.78's exclude-list with a per-submodule-ownership split: (a) own-org submodules (full write access via the project's CLIs — canonical orgs `vasic-digital` + `HelixDevelopment`) MUST be INCLUDED in the index; (b) third-party submodules (the §11.4.74 `no-match → vendor` path) MUST be EXCLUDED. Operational steps: (1) `git submodule update --remote --merge` to pull latest before re-indexing, respecting load-bearing pins on third-party submodules; (2) adjust `.codegraph/config.json` exclude list to keep own-org paths in scope; (3) re-index via `scripts/codegraph_setup.sh`; (4) verify via `scripts/codegraph_validate.sh` with ≥1 probe resolving a symbol living ONLY inside an own-org submodule; (5) paired §1.1 mutation — temporarily add the own-org submodule to exclude → validate MUST FAIL on the cross-submodule probe → restore. An index that lies about reachable symbols is a PASS-bluff against AI agents. Own-org submodules silently excluded without an audit trail in `.codegraph/config.json` comments is a release blocker.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.79` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-79-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.79 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.80 — CodeGraph Regular-Update + Sync Automation Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.80)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"We MUST regularly check for the updates and execute codegraph npm updates so the latest version of it is always installed on the host machine! ... Make sure we have proper full automation bash scripts which will run regularly and that these are part of the constitution Submodule ... Make sure all updates, sync processes we do and important codegraph related events are all documented under docs/codegraph in Status and Status_Summary documents ... and regularly export them like all other Status docs into the PDF and HTML!"*

Three deliverables (all living in the constitution submodule, inherited by reference per §3 — consuming projects invoke at `${CONST_DIR}/scripts/codegraph_*.sh`, never copy): (1) `scripts/codegraph_update.sh` — npm-installs latest `@colbymchenry/codegraph` after a registry version check; appends old/new version to `docs/codegraph/Status.md`; anti-bluff verifies `codegraph --version` reflects the new version after install (npm exit 0 ≠ working binary). (2) `scripts/codegraph_sync.sh` — after a successful update runs `codegraph status` → `codegraph sync .` → `codegraph status` → the project's `scripts/codegraph_validate.sh`; appends every step's output to BOTH the project's and the constitution's `docs/codegraph/Status.md`. (3) `docs/codegraph/Status.md` + `Status_Summary.md` append-only ledgers, exported to `.html` + `.pdf` per §11.4.65. Cadence: weekly floor (per §11.4.45). A consuming project that has not run `codegraph_update.sh` in >2 weeks AND has open AI-agent work is a release blocker. Paired §1.1 mutation: downgrade installed version → script detects drift → restore.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.80` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-80-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.80 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.81 — Cross-Platform-Parity Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.81)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"Any Linux-only blocker / issue we have MUST BE created macOS and other supported platforms equivalent! So, depending on platform proper implementation will be used for particular OS! EVERYTHING MUST BE PROPERLY EXTENDED AND UPDATED!"*

Every consuming project whose supported-platforms manifest lists more than one OS MUST, for every feature/test/gate/challenge/mutation depending on platform-specific primitives, ship a per-OS-equivalent implementation chosen at runtime via `uname -s` (or equivalent detection). Three sub-mandates: **(A) Per-OS implementation REQUIRED** — Linux cgroup/systemd/`/proc` primitives MUST have documented per-OS equivalents (POSIX `setrlimit`/`ulimit`, macOS `launchd`, BSD `rctl`, Windows Job Object) chosen via runtime dispatch. **(B) Per-OS tests REQUIRED** — every platform-dependent gate test MUST have `case "$(uname -s)" in` branches with positive captured evidence per §11.4.2 + §11.4.5 in each branch; SKIP-with-reason acceptable ONLY when the platform genuinely cannot enforce the invariant. **(C) Honest kernel-gap citation + adjacent equivalent test REQUIRED** — where a Linux primitive has NO equivalent due to a documented kernel limitation (canonical: XNU does not enforce `RLIMIT_AS` for unprivileged processes), the test MUST detect the gap at runtime, SKIP with exact kernel reason + reproducer + honest-gap-doc link, AND provide an ADJACENT test exercising the closest invariant the platform CAN enforce (e.g. `RLIMIT_CPU`+`SIGXCPU` as the macOS proxy), itself anti-bluff with a paired §1.1 mutation. Gate `CM-CROSS-PLATFORM-PARITY` scans for `case "$(uname -s)"` blocks asserting a non-SKIP branch (or honest-gap citation) per platform in the manifest; paired mutation strips a Darwin branch → gate FAILs. No escape hatch.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.81` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-81-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker on multi-platform projects.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.81 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.82 — Iteration-Speedup Discipline Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.82)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"How can we speed-up this whole development and fixing process? ...

Iteration cycle time is a first-order quality enabler. Every consuming project's build / test / commit / debug pipeline MUST adopt these speedup disciplines AS MANDATORY (each independently enforceable): (A) Phase-1 forensic (`superpowers:systematic-debugging`) before any speculative source patch — speculative patches without FACT-grade root cause are §11.4.6 + §11.4.82 violations; (B) Live-ADB-First (or live-equivalent) before any rebuild — strengthens §11.4.51 to a release-blocker mandate; (C) 30-second pre-flight before launching rebuild orchestrators (device/sink reachability, host memory/disk, no stale locks, no orphan processes); (D) persistent build caches outside containers (`ccache`/`sccache`/Gradle daemon bind-mounted to host); (E) module-only rebuild for loadable-module-only changes; (F) parallel multi-device testing with separate `qa-results/<TS>/<device-tag>/` outputs; (G) subagent scope discipline + worktree isolation (≤30 min budget, single-responsibility, `isolation: "worktree"` default); (H) lock-file + stale-process hygiene (clean `.git/index.lock`, disable auto git-gc in concurrent repos); (I) cycle telemetry per §11.4.24 (commit hash, per-phase wall-clock, speedup-flag set, outcome — aggregated weekly). Gate `CM-ITERATION-SPEEDUP-DISCIPLINE` audits recent cycles for telemetry citing which of (A)-(I) applied; paired §1.1 mutation strips the speedup-flag column → gate FAILs. No escape hatch — no `--skip-phase1-forensic`, `--no-pre-flight`, `--rebuild-everything-always`, `--unlimited-subagent-scope`, `--ignore-locks`, `--no-telemetry` flag.

## §11.4.83 — docs/qa/ End-User Evidence Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.83)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"every feature that ships MUST carry a recorded e2e communication transcript + any attached materials under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` (per-feature subdirectories). A feature with no QA transcript is itself a §107 PASS-bluff — it claims to work but has no auditable runtime evidence. Bot-driven automation MUST preserve full bidirectional communication threads as proof."*

Every feature that ships MUST carry a recorded end-to-end communication transcript plus any attached materials (screenshots, request/response payloads, audio, file uploads) committed under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` — one directory per feature run. Operative rule: (1) every consuming project MUST maintain a `docs/qa/` tree, each new feature under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` where `<run-id>` is monotonic + greppable (timestamp / ATM-NNN / other workable-item ID per §11.4.54); (2) transcripts MUST be full bidirectional — every prompt/command sent + every response received (one-sided is not a transcript); (3) attached materials MUST be committed in-repo (no external-only links — that is a §11.4.13 sink-side violation); (4) bot-driven / agent-driven QA automation MUST preserve the full conversation thread as the proof artefact; (5) release gates MUST refuse to tag a version that has any feature-shipping commit without its matching `docs/qa/<run-id>/` directory. A feature with no QA transcript is a §11.4 / §107 PASS-bluff. Composes with §11.4.2 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.13 / §11.4.65 / §11.4.69 / §1.1.

## §11.4.84 — Working-Tree Quiescence Rule for Subagent Commits (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.84)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"no subagent commit may proceed while any concurrent mutation gate is in flight in the same checkout. Before `git add`, the committing agent MUST `grep` its own working tree for mutation markers (`MUTATED for paired`, `// always pass`, `return json.Marshal` shortcut paths, etc.). Any unexplained file in the staging area triggers ABORT."*

No subagent (or main-thread) commit may proceed while any concurrent mutation gate, paired-mutation experiment, or other in-flight mutation is live in the same checkout. Before `git add`, the committing agent MUST grep its own working tree for mutation markers (`MUTATED for paired`, `// always pass`, `return json.Marshal` shortcut paths, `// MUTATION` / `# MUTATION` annotations, `_mutated_*` filename suffixes, etc.) and explicitly account for every modified file in the staging area; any unexplained file → ABORT. (Forensic case: a logo-fix subagent's `git add` swept an `// always pass` JWT-verify mutation residue into an unrelated commit pushed to all four mirrors — a real security-defect window.) Operative rule: (1) pre-`git add` greps for mutation markers + cross-checks `git status --porcelain` against the subagent's declared scope; unaccounted entries → ABORT; (2) any active mutation gate MUST be serialised (mutate → assert FAIL → restore → assert PASS) and the working tree verifiably clean before any unrelated commit; (3) concurrent subagents in the SAME checkout MUST coordinate through a lockfile (`.git/MUTATION_IN_PROGRESS`) — cleaner solution is `git worktree add` per subagent (composes with §11.4.20/§11.4.70); (4) post-commit `mutation-residue-scanner` MUST run before push — any commit containing a mutation marker → push BLOCKED.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.84` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-84-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. A mutation marker that lands in a tagged commit is a critical defect regardless of how briefly it persisted.

## §11.4.85 — Stress + Chaos Test Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.85)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-24): *"Every fix or improvement you do MUST BE covered with full automation stress and chaos tests so we are sure nothing can break the functionality and all edge cases are monitored and polished and additionally fixed if that is needed! Everything must produce rock solid proofs and follow fully no-bluff policy!"*

Every fix or improvement landed MUST ship with full-automation **stress** AND **chaos** test suites exercising edge cases, sustained load, concurrent contention, and failure-injection. Happy-path coverage alone is a §11.4 / §107 PASS-bluff at the resilience layer. **Stress** (closed-set): sustained load (N ≥ 100 iterations OR ≥ 30 s wall-clock, p50/p95/p99 latency recorded) + concurrent contention (N ≥ 10 parallel invocations, no deadlock/leak) + boundary conditions (empty/max/off-by-one, each categorised). **Chaos** (closed-set, per fix-class appropriateness): process-death injection + network-fault injection (drop/delay/reorder) + input-corruption injection + resource-exhaustion injection (disk full, OOM, FD exhaustion — refuse cleanly OR degrade, NEVER crash) + state-corruption injection (mid-flight lock loss, partial-write). Every stress + chaos PASS MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact path per §11.4.5 + §11.4.69. Helper library `stress_chaos.sh` provides `ab_stress_run`, `ab_stress_concurrent`, `ab_chaos_kill_pid_during`, `ab_chaos_drop_network_during`, `ab_chaos_corrupt_file_during`, `ab_chaos_oom_pressure_during`, `ab_chaos_disk_full_during`, each composing with `ab_pass_with_evidence` / `ab_skip_with_reason`. Cleanup non-negotiable in `trap '...' EXIT` (cleanup failure = §11.4.14 violation). Four-layer coverage per §11.4.4(b) + paired §1.1 mutation (strip chaos-injection or evidence-capture → gate FAILs). No escape hatch — no `--skip-stress`, `--no-chaos`, `--happy-path-suffices`, `--stress-test-later` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.85` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-85-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.86 — Roster/Corpus-Backed Status-Doc Auto-Sync Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.86)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-25): *"Make sure that assets and players Status docs are ALWAYS regularly updated and in sync like all others Status docs — any time we add or modify the assets content(s) or we change or add new / remove existing pre-installed video and audio player apps! This MUST WORK OUT OF THE BOX!"*

Some Status docs (§11.4.45) are backed by a tracked roster (installed apps/components) or a tracked asset corpus (test/media asset directory) rather than narrative alone. Their freshness MUST NOT depend on operator vigilance — the moment a roster/corpus member changes (app added/removed/renamed; asset added/modified/removed) the Status doc + Status_Summary + HTML + PDF MUST resync out of the box, mechanically. Mechanism (all must hold): (1) drift-proof fingerprint — sha256 of the sorted member list (NOT mtime), persisted in a sidecar beside the Status doc; (2) a sync helper that regenerates the fingerprint + re-exports HTML+PDF via the §11.4.65 exporter, wired so sync is automatic; (3) a pre-build gate that FAILs when the live fingerprint differs from the persisted one (mirrors §11.4.12 `CM-ISSUES-SUMMARY-SYNC` + §11.4.45 `sync_integration_status`); (4) a paired §1.1 mutation corrupting the fingerprint and asserting the gate FAILs. Classification: universal — the consuming project supplies the specific docs, roster/corpus sources, helper, and gate name per §11.4.35.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.86` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-86-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.

## §11.4.87 — Endless-Loop Autonomous Work + Zero-Idle Agent Dispatch + Anti-Bluff Testing Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.87)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-26): *"continue in endless loop fully autonomously"* (and any semantically-equivalent phrasing).

When the operator instructs an AI agent to continue in an endless autonomous loop, the agent MUST treat it as a HARD-CONTRACT covenant: (A) continue working until `docs/Issues.md` Status-column has zero non-terminal entries AND `docs/CONTINUATION.md` §3 Active work is empty AND no background subagent is mid-execution AND no external dependency is in-flight; (B) dispatch background subagents for parallelisable work — main + every subagent operate concurrently, "waiting for results" is the ONLY acceptable idle reason; (C) every closure lands four-layer test coverage per §11.4.4(b) with captured-evidence (audio/video/network/UI/sysfs physical proofs); (D) the §11.4 anti-bluff covenant family (§11.4.1 / §11.4.2 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.27 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.52 / §11.4.68 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.83) is the operative truth-discipline — tests AND HelixQA Challenges bound equally; (E) the loop terminates ONLY on all-conditions-met, explicit operator STOP, host-session-safety demand, or scheduled wake on a known-future-actionable signal. No escape hatch — no `--idle-OK`, `--skip-endless-loop`, `--bluff-permitted-for-this-task`, `--metadata-only-test-suffices`, `--no-physical-proof-required` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.87` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-87-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.88 — Background-Push Mandate: Commit-Lock Release Immediately After Commit, Push Runs Detached (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.88)

Forensic anchor (2026-05-26): a single `commit_all.sh` held its flock ~5 hours because `do_push` ran synchronously after the commit landed — every subsequent commit blocked on a slow mirror push irrelevant to the local commit's durability. Implementation seam for §11.4.87(B) zero-idle. The mandate: (A) `.git/.commit_all.lock` MUST be released IMMEDIATELY after `git commit` returns 0 — the commit is durable on local disk regardless of remote push outcome; (B) push runs detached via `nohup ./push_all.sh ... > <log> 2>&1 &` + `disown` — the orchestrator's exit code reports COMMIT success, NOT push success; (C) `push_all.sh` acquires per-remote flock `.git/.push.<remote>.lock` so concurrent invocations targeting the same remote serialize but different-remote invocations run in parallel; (D) backgrounded push failures land in `qa-results/push_failures/<ts>_<remote>.log` — the next autonomous-loop tick checks per §11.4.87(A) "no external dependency in-flight" gate; (E) synchronous-push escape: explicit `--sync-push` CLI flag preserves legacy behaviour for §11.4.41 force-push merge-first audit paths. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-88-PROPAGATION` + `CM-BACKGROUND-PUSH-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutations. Synchronous push (without `--sync-push`) = §11.4 PASS-bluff at the execution layer.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.88` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-88-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — no escape hatch beyond `--sync-push` for force-push events.

## §11.4.89 — Background Test Execution Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.89)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Any tests we are executing, especially long test cycles, MUST BE performed in background in parallel with main work stream! This MUST NOT block our capabilities to work on queued workable items. Main work stream can be blocked or sit iddle only if absolutely needed and if it depends hard on results of some background execution."*

Symmetric anchor to §11.4.88 (background push) at the test-execution layer. Mandate: (A) long-running tests (>30 s expected: `pre_build`, `meta_test`, `test_all_fixes`, `recent_work_validate`, HelixQA banks, 4-phase cycles, full-suite retests, audio supervisors, dual-display recorders) MUST run via `nohup ... > <log> 2>&1 &` + `disown` with the log under a known dir (`qa-results/<test_id>_<ts>.log`); (B) the main stream proceeds to the §11.4.42 priority queue immediately; (C) hard-dependency gating — poll an exit-status file or `pgrep -af <test>` before steps that need the exit code, surfacing as §11.4.66 interactive options if the test is still running; (D) failures land in `<log>` files, the next loop tick checks; (E) foreground execution permitted ONLY for <30 s tests OR explicit operator authorisation; (F) per-script flock serialises same-script invocations, different-script invocations parallel. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-89-PROPAGATION` + `CM-BACKGROUND-TEST-EXECUTION-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutations.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.89` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-89-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — no escape hatch beyond explicit per-invocation operator authorisation.

## §11.4.90 — Obsolete Status + Per-Item Obsolescence Audit (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.90)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Bug No 6 ... seems obsolete after latest request for new behavior ... mark obsolete tickets with some light gray background ... text - the description to be strikethrough styled ... review all existing open or resolved workable items if they are obsolete - not valid any more ... There MUST NOT be any mistake! No bluff is allowed of any kind!"*

The §11.4.15 Status closed-set is extended with a terminal `Obsolete (→ Fixed.md)` value (orthogonal to Type per §11.4.16). Obsolescence reasons (closed vocabulary): `superseded-by-design-change | superseded-by-later-mandate | feature-removed | duplicate-of | unsupported-topology`. Every Obsolete heading MUST carry an `**Obsolete-Details:**` line (Since + Reason + Superseding-item + Triple-check evidence) within 8 non-blank lines. The §11.4.23 colorizer adds a `cell-status-obsolete` class — light-gray `#E0E0E0` background + strikethrough description. Audit cadence: every release-gate sweep per §11.4.40 + §11.4.42; triple-check is non-negotiable per the operator mandate. Composes with §11.4.15 / §11.4.16 / §11.4.19 / §11.4.21 / §11.4.23 / §11.4.33 / §11.4.34 / §11.4.40 / §11.4.42 / §11.4.66 / §11.4.71.

For each workable item we MUST HAVE clearly understandable meaning ... every team member can clearly understand what that particular workable item is exactly about! There cannot be misunderstanding or unclearity of any kind and no bluff allowed!"*

Every summary entry (Issues_Summary, Fixed_Summary, README doc-link, Status_Summary pages 1+2, all one-liners) MUST contain a self-contained meaningful description ≥ 6 words OR ≥ 40 chars naming SUBJECT + PROBLEM/GOAL. Forbidden one-liner anti-patterns: section labels (`Composes with`, `Closure criteria`, `Fix direction`, etc.); bare metadata fragments (`Critical`, `Bug`, `In progress`, etc.); section-marker echoes; a §-letter alone. Generators (`generate_issues_summary.sh` / `generate_fixed_summary.sh` / `update_readme_doc_links.sh` / `generate_status_summary.sh`) MUST extract from the H1/H2 heading line per the §11.4.54 ATM-NNN convention, NEVER from arbitrary downstream text, and MUST refuse anti-pattern rows — emitting a `(MISSING DESCRIPTION — fix source heading)` placeholder with visual highlight. Gate `CM-SUMMARY-CLARITY-DESCRIPTIONS` scans every summary; an anti-pattern match = FAIL. Audit cadence: every §11.4.40 + §11.4.42 sweep.

After we do change or set of changes this mandatory steps MUST BE taken!"*

Every non-trivial change MUST pass a 5-pass evaluation BEFORE it is commit-ready: **(Pass 1)** main-task verification — change achieves the stated goal, captured-evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.69; **(Pass 2)** regression-blast-radius analysis — enumerate every direct dependency, demonstrate no contract break; **(Pass 3)** cross-feature interaction analysis — audit parallel features sharing state/timing/hardware/shell environment; **(Pass 4)** deep-research validation per §11.4.8 — external precedent OR "NO external solution found — original work" + CodeGraph queries per §11.4.78/§11.4.79; **(Pass 5)** anti-bluff confirmation per §11.4 / §11.4.1 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.27 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.52 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.83 — no new bluff surface introduced. Each pass is documented (commit footers OR `docs/` entries OR `qa-results/` evidence). Only after all 5 passes complete may commit/push/test/release proceed.

The text-based Issues/Fixed/Summary/CONTINUATION constellation is converted to a SQLite-DB-backed single source of truth. Schema mandatory tables: `items` (atm_id PK + Type + Status incl. Obsolete + Severity + title + description ≥40 chars + created/modified + composes_with JSON + current_location); `item_history` (append-only audit per §11.4.34 By/Reason/Evidence); `obsolete_details` (§11.4.90); `operator_block_details` (§11.4.21); `firebase_metadata` (§11.4.47); `meta` (schema version + last sync + integrity hash). A Go binary at `cmd/workable-items/` provides `sync md-to-db` / `db-to-md` / `diff` / `validate` / `add` / `close`; bidirectional regen is byte-identical round-trip (closed-set whitespace/section-order tolerance). `commit_all.sh` refuses on non-empty diff; `sync_issues_docs.sh` invokes the Go binary; pre-build runs `workable-items validate`. Anti-bluff: unit + integration + stress (1000-row insert + 10 concurrent writers) + chaos (mid-write SIGKILL + corrupt-DB recovery + disk-full) + paired §1.1 mutation + HelixQA Challenge `CME-WORKABLE-ITEMS-001`. The Go binary lives in the constitution submodule (`constitution/scripts/workable-items/`) per §11.4.74.

An operational catalogue for the canonical long-running workload (multi-hour containerised build per §12.9). **SAFE during build:** (A) MD/docs work; (B) generator/helper script work under `scripts/`; (C) pre-build + meta-test gate authoring + paired §1.1 mutations; (D) on-device test scripts; (E) constitution submodule edits + push; (F) any submodule commit + push per §11.4.88; (G) read-only live-ADB probes (`dumpsys`/`getprop`/`cat /proc/...`/`screencap`/`logcat`); (H) subagent dispatch per §11.4.20/§11.4.70 + §11.4.84 quiescence; (I) web research + external API queries with §11.4.10 credentials; (J) workable-items DB ops per §11.4.93+§11.4.95; (K) backgrounded pre-build + meta-test execution per §11.4.89. **UNSAFE during build:** (α) `git checkout`/`reset --hard`/`clean -df` on the source tree (use `git worktree`); (β) mass file deletes/renames under built source trees; (γ) submodule pointer updates affecting built artefacts; (δ) `out/` mutations; (ε) `make clean`/`m clobber`/`rm -rf out/`; (ζ) container destruction; (η) disk-filling breaching §12.9 free-space minimum; (θ) §12 host-session-safety breaches. Conductor responsibility: before EVERY pause point during a long build, consult the catalogue, identify (A)-(K) queue items per §11.4.42+§11.4.72, and dispatch ≥1 per §11.4.20/§11.4.70 subagent default + §11.4.89 background. "Build running, nothing else to do" is NEVER true per §11.4.94+§11.4.96. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-96-PROPAGATION` + `CM-PARALLEL-WORK-DURING-BUILD-AUDIT` + paired §1.1 mutations.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.96` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-96-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.96 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.97 — Maximum-Use-of-Idle-Time + Progress-Update Cadence (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.97)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"keep it working, we should do as much as possible, if not it all but as much as we can as long as there is iddle time! it MUST be used! ... keep us updated about all progress and all phisycal proofs and gathered data as you progress through all open workable items!"*

Operating-mode capstone strengthening §11.4.87 + §11.4.94 + §11.4.96: (A) every minute of conductor idle time during which work could autonomously progress AND is not genuinely blocked = a §11.4.97 violation; "as much as possible, if not it all but as much as we can" is operative — dispatch CONTINUOUSLY through the entire idle window, not just at scheduled wakes; (B) progress-update cadence — emit an operator-facing 1-line update at every commit landed / subagent return / constitutional anchor / captured evidence / milestone closure, no operator prompt required; (C) continuous physical-proof gathering per §11.4.5 + §11.4.6 + §11.4.69 — every autonomous closure cites captured-evidence (evidence path goes into the §11.4.93 `item_history.evidence_path` when the DB lands); (D) composes with §11.4.5/6/13/20/27/42/50/52/69/70/72/83/85/87/88/89/94/96; (E) the idle-only-when-blocked closed-set is unchanged from §11.4.94(A). Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-97-PROPAGATION` + `CM-IDLE-TIME-AUDIT` + paired §1.1 mutations.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.97` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-97-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.97 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.95 — Workable-Items SQLite DB Is TRACKED in Git, NEVER Gitignored (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.95)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"We shall not Git ignore our workable items SQlite DB since it is our single source of truth ... workable items SQlite DB regularly commited and pushed to all upstreams!"*

§11.4.93's earlier "gitignored per §11.4.30" clause is AMENDED — the DB at `docs/workable_items.db` is TRACKED in git, NEVER gitignored. It IS authoritative source data, NOT a build artefact. Every `workable-items sync md-to-db` that mutates state MUST stage + commit + push the DB alongside the MD regen per §11.4.19 atomic-move + §2.1 multi-upstream push. A WAL-checkpoint (`PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) is required before commit-stage so the transient `.db-wal` + `.db-shm` sidecars (gitignored per §11.4.30) are safely discardable. The §11.4.77 regeneration mechanism does NOT apply — the DB IS the source. Destructive DB ops require §9.2 hardlinked-backup + operator authorization; §11.4.41 force-push merge-first applies if DB history ever needs rewrite. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-95-PROPAGATION` + `CM-WORKABLE-ITEMS-DB-TRACKED` + paired §1.1 mutation.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.95` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-95-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.95 for the full mandate.
